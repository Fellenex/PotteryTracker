# PotteryTracker
App for tracking pottery progress



## Idea
I love tracking things by writing in journals, but pottery pieces often go through many times of being touched, at fairly distant intervals.
Especially as someone who uses a local shared pottery studio and can only attend once/week based on their schedule, it can
    take months to go from a lump of clay to a finished product.
(Even longer if there's any delay before glazing, something I find myself only doing in bulk.)
Not only that, but you interact with such a piece at least three times (throwing, trimming, glazing)
    and with two firings inbetween before it's finished.



## Features Roadmap
1. Can create a new pottery entry, which is stored + loaded from a .json file
2. Can edit existing pottery entries, re-using the creation UI
3. Predetermined set of bulk edits
   - select many, mark all as trimmed/glazed
   - select many, change the thrown/trimmed/glazed date
4. Can filter the list of displayed pottery entries based on date range, label, clay body, glazed used, notes
5. Can upload an image for a pottery entry
   - Draw an image on a little canvas
   - Take a picture
   - Upload a picture
   - (Should all also be possible as a bulk edit option).
